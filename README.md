# odin-web-page-design

The "Webpage Design from Scratch" project aims to showcase the skills of the developer in creating an entire web page using HTML, CSS, and Flexbox. The project involves recreating a provided design with the goal of achieving a layout that closely resembles the original design, provided by The Odin Project.

The design assets for the project consist of two images: one representing the complete website design and the other providing details about the fonts and colors used.

The project serves as a practical exercise for developers to apply their knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Flexbox to create a functional and visually appealing web page. By completing this project, developers can enhance their understanding of front-end web development concepts and gain experience in building web pages from scratch.
